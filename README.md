# Mastodon, but quacks

A fork of Mastodon that cares a lot about performance. The `streaming` module is replaced with [mastoduck](https://github.com/nametoolong/mastoduck). Around half of the serializers have been replaced with [blueprinter](https://github.com/procore/blueprinter). The controllers received another bunch of micro optimizations. Use at your own risk!

Please report bugs to the [mastoduck](https://github.com/nametoolong/mastoduck) repository.
